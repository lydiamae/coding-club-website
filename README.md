# Group (WIS) Website

This project aims to serve as a public-facing website for a group or club at a university, so that anyone interested in the group has a place to get more information and/or contact the organization.

## Features

- Uses regular expressions to validate user input; prevents the invalid input and informs the user about it
- Analyzes text and displays useful information about it (character counter in contact form message field)
- Retrieves data from a third-party (Google Maps JS) API and use it to display a map within the app.
